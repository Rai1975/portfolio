        "> First place winner ($5,000) of the Future of Data Hackathon at Midwestcon, with over 900 participants and 70+  teams.\n> Whitebox bridges the gap between AI and human reasoning by transforming credible texts, such as medical textbooks, into structured graphs. This transformation not only enhances the AI’s ability to understand and reason through complex material but also provides a level of explainability that traditional AI models often lack. By breaking the content down into interconnected nodes, Whitebox enables users to trace the AI’s thought process step by step, unlocking ethical applications in fields where transparency is critical.",
